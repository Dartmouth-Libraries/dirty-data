# Workshop Dirty Data

Sometimes the data you want to work with is neatly organized, tidy, and complete, for example a published dataset. Often, however, you are stuck with a loose collection of datapoints, possibly even 
from different sources. They may be incomplete, incongruous, poorly structured, in a word: dirty!
This workshop will equip you with techniques to deal with Dirty Data such as data wrangling, cleaning, conversion, and imputation. We will use Python and the Pandas package in code-along examples, 
but the presented techniques are universal and can be applied in any programming language.
