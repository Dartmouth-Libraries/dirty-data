# Workshop Dirty Data

Data processing of any kind (statistical analysis, machine learning, visualizations, ...) requires neatly and consistently structured data. In published dataset, much work has usually been done to make sure that all data points adhere to a common format and structure so that whatever processing we plan on doing can start right away. 

Often, however, and especially when we collect our own data, the datapoints can be a bit of a mess: Maybe we tapped different sources, which delivered data in different formats. Maybe some of our data points are incomplete. Maybe we have to convert some of our data to be able to process it. In a word: our data is dirty!

In this workshop, we will look at some selected techniques to deal with Dirty Data in a systematic and effective way.
